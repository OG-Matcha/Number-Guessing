<hr>

## Functions

* **game()** : The main game loop

* **print_rounds()** : Print out the current round of the game

* **check_type()** : The function is used to check the types we want to input such as upper & lower bounds and number, then it will print corresponding prompt

## Rules

1. First you can set the range of number you want to guess (upper & lower bounds)

2. The chances you can guess is the range take binary logarithm, which means 
**You will have a big chance to guess the correct number whatever the range is big or not**.

3. In this program, negative numbers, floating-points are not valid to be input, you will be ask to enter again (only positive integer).

4. Have fun with it.
